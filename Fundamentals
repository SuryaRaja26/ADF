Integration runtime: is the compute infrastructure. An integration runtime provides the bridge between activities and linked services. 
Three types:
Azure integration runtime
Self-hosted integration runtime
Azure-SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) integration runtime


Validation Activity:
--------------------
Is used to ensure the pipeline only continues execution once it has been validated.Timeout->Waiting for file at this time duration if the file not received then validation activity will timeout.
Sleep->A delay in validation attempts.

Metadata
---------
Used to retrieve the metadata about the file. The maximum size of returned metadata is 4MB.

If condition:
-------------
It will execute the true activity when it satisfied the condition or else it will execute the failed activity. In case they didn't add the fail activity it will
not the show the failure. 

Delete:
-------
used to delete the files. Use the recursive option when you are using folders.

Parameters:
----------
Are used to pass external values to the pipeline, datasets, and linked services. the value cannot be changed inside a pipeline

Variables:
---------
used as internal variables set inside a pipeline these value can be changed inside the pipeline using set varia;be or append activity


Mapping data flows:
-------------------
used to perform data transformation.Code-free environment.
  Schema drift:
  -------------
  whenever a new column is added to the dataset it will automatically add the column to the dataflow.
Select transformation:
----------------------
used to delete columns and rename column names as well.
Rule based mapping: used to change column names according to rules.
